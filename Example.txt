# 1. Create Game of Life Object with a Random Raster of dimension 10w by 10h
# Store the Game of Life Object in Variable x
x = GameofLife(width=10,height=10)

# 2. Cycle the Game Board
# Run through 10 cycles
x.cycle(10)
# Run through 5 cycles
x.cycle(5)

# 3. Reset the Game Board
x.reset() # Reset to the beginning board

# 4. Change Settings
x.speed = 1 # pause for 1 second every cycle
x.overwrite = False # do not overwrite cycles, display all of them as layers

# 5. Cycle the Game Board after a Reset
# Run through 8 cycles
x.cycle(8)

# New Game
# Create a new Game of Life Object, but with a Given Raster
x = GameofLife(raster="path_to_raster_file")
